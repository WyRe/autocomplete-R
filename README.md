# Autocomplete+ provider for R statistical software for atom text editor

## Method

Scripts R were made to parse R documentation to a json file.

Default R packages were implemented.

```
print(.packages())
```

To implement more packages you just need to execute `.atom/packages/autocomplete-R/R/packages_new.R`.
