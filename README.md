#Autocomplete+ provider for R statistical software for atom text editor

## Method

### A script was made to parse R documentation and a json file was build (perfectible)
see R/scrapeRdoc.R

### Coffeescript parse json and autocomplete function


## Note
I'm a noob in coffeescript so this package functionalities could be largely improve.

Also, any suggestions are welcome!

Feel free to contribute!
